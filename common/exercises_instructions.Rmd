### Instructions

- If you haven't already, install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 

- Download the <a href="https://ajlyons.github.io/rspatialdata/data.zip">data file</a> from the <a href="`r lstCI$githubrepo`" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>, and unzip it to My Documents. 

- Create a new R script in RStudio (File &rarr; New File &rarr; R Script). 

- Copy the questions below (all of which begin with the _#_ character so RStudio will interpret them as a comment) into your script. Under each question, write R code. Run each line of R code as you enter it (press the Run button or ctrl+enter) to make sure it works.

- Remember to save your script periodically to avoid losing work if RStudio crashes.

- If you get stuck, click on the 'hint' link, or the question number to see the answer. Click again to hide.

- If you have any questions or problems, please feel free to email the instructor.
